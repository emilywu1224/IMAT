<span class='line'>  2</span> YOU ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED FROM MODIFYING ANYTHING IN THE IMAT CORE DIRECTORY 
<span class='line'>  3</span> THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE IMMEDIATE PLANS TO GIVE BACK TO THE IMAT OPEN SOURCE 
<span class='line'>  4</span> PROJECT. THIS IS FOR TWO REASONS:
<span class='line'>  5</span> 
<span class='line'>  6</span> 1. In the future, we plan to add features to IMAT which will enable it to auto 
<span class='line'>  7</span> update itself over time as it is patched and improved. These patches will very 
<span class='line'>  8</span> likely overwrite the entire IMAT core directory, and thus, cause you due 
<span class='line'>  9</span> frustration and headache.
<span class='line'> 10</span> 
<span class='line'> 11</span> 2. Its just plain rude to improve open source code and not share it with people. 
<span class='line'> 12</span> Plus, you lose an opportunity to add "Open source rockstar" to your resume.
<span class='line'> 13</span> 
<span class='line'> 14</span> So there! Consider yourself warned. :-)
