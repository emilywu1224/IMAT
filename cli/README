This is the top project directory for the Ginsu command line interface to ginsu. The ginsu command
line tool will be able to do the following things...

-Initialize The Environment to make sure that any and all testing tools can work together.

-Kickstart a project using auto-generation tools. This will allow testers to get their project set
up faster, using proven design and testing patterns

-Generate object UI Maps 

-abstract away the use of multiple tools and processes (like XCode's Instruments, The Selenium RC 
server) and orchestrate them to initialize the tests, run them, and report on them using a common
standard of JUnit Reports.
