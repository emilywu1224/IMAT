The Intuit Mobile Automation Toolkit (IMAT) makes automating your iOS App 
easier.

Apple's UI Automation framework is great. Yet, we felt there were some gaps that 
needed to be filled. 

Using IMAT you can... 

-Generate a new automation project from scratch.
-Follow patterns to help minimize test script maintenance.
-Slice and dice your test suites with a couple of lines of code.
-Enumerate manual test cases along side your automated tests.
-Run your tests from the Command Line (Device and Simulator both!).
-Generate Junit Style XML that you can integrate with the CI Build server of your 
choice.
