	Delete all files from the target dir. Attempt to set the permissions on the directory
	first, to be sure that they can be deleted. Note, on UNIX systems, copied files
	do not have their permissions preserved. Therefore we need to grant our own 
	permissions to reliably delete any artifacts that were created during testing.
