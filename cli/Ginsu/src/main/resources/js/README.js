YOU ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED FROM MODIFYING ANYTHING IN THE GINSU CORE DIRECTORY THAT YOU DO NOT 
HAVE IMMEDIATE PLANS TO GIVE BACK TO THE GINSU OPEN SOURCE PROJECT. THIS IS FOR TWO REASONS:

1. Ginsu auto updates itself over time as it is patched and improved. These patches will very likely
overwrite the entire ginsu core directory.

2. Its just plain rude to improve open source code and not share it with people. So there.
