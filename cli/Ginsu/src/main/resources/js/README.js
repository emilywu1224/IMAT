/*
YOU ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED FROM MODIFYING ANYTHING IN THE IMAT CORE DIRECTORY 
THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE IMMEDIATE PLANS TO GIVE BACK TO THE IMAT OPEN SOURCE 
PROJECT. THIS IS FOR TWO REASONS:

1. In the future, we plan to add features to IMAT which will enable it to auto 
update itself over time as it is patched and improved. These patches will very 
likely overwrite the entire IMAT core directory, and thus, cause you due 
frustration and headache.

2. Its just plain rude to improve open source code and not share it with people. 
Plus, you lose an opportunity to add "Open source rockstar" to your resume.

So there! Consider yourself warned. :-)
